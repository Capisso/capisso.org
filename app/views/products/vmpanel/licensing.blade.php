<h1>Capisso VMPanel Licensing</h1>

<p>Although Licensing is not final, we're thinking the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Panel: One time payment of $100 ($75 for first month signupers!)</li>
    <li>Node: $3.00/mo/node</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this allows us the flexibility to continue developing with the same quality of work. I want your feedback
    though, let us know what you think on our IRC channel above.</p>
